                    <p>The charts above are prevalence of BMI scaled to 1 instead of percentage. Based on the charts above, it can be seen that those of normal BMI decreases as years goes by. It can also be seen that there are more males with normal BMI compared to females. The other three charts show that prevalence of obesity increases as years go by and is higher in women compared to men.</p>

              <p>The chart above displays the prevalence of insufficient physical activity in school-going adolescents aged 11-17 years old in different WHO regions. It can be seen that most regions have very slight improvement from years 2001 to 2016 while Europe remains constant and Easter Mediterranean increases. Overall, the decrease in this prevalence in 2016 signifies that children are becoming slightly more active. However, these values are still considerably lacking and needs more work as the future generation are the ones who will be impacted most by obesity.</p>

              <h2>Total daily per capita fat intake '(g)'</h2>
              <p>Now, we will take a look at the top 5 OECD Countries in terms of Obesity rates from years 1961 to 2019. This chart clearly portrays the daily total fat supply in these countries normalized to the scale of 1. It can also be seen clearly that USA has the highest total fat supply among these countries.</p>

              <h2>Factors that affect obesity</h2>
              <p>Lastly, we have the factors that affect obesity in terms of diet and meals such as Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC), Number of main meals (NCP), Consumption of water daily (CH20). There are 4 frequency levels 1 to 4 with 1 being the most frequent which also affect the count of frequency in weight levels which is the partition in each pie.</p>
              <h3>Relationship</h3>
              <p>The higher the FCVC, the lower the rate of Obesity.</p>
              <p>The higher the NCP, the higher the rate of Obesity.</p>
              <p>The higher the CH2O, the lower the rate of Obesity.</p>
